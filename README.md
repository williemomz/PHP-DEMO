# SAMPLE PHP & MYSQL PROJECT

Database and table structure I have used for this application is in the sql directory.
To modify Database settings to a remote or local database, please edit the db.php file.
New users can sign up and log in to view their profile or update their profile.
Session for each user is set to expire after 5 minutes, where user is alerted and logged out.
Take time and try it out, Thank you.
